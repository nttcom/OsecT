# OsecT

## What's this ?

OsecT is a visualization technology that shows the elements that make up a security risk, such as equipment, communication status, vulnerabilities, and threats in the control system by collecting, accumulating, and analyzing data from control system networks with various protocols.

[WideAngle Professional Service OsecT](https://www.ntt.com/business/services/security/security-management/wideangle/osect.html) is now available as a commercial service (in Japanese).

## Features

The main features are as follows.

### Installation without affecting the control system

- Is is available by simply connecting to the switch mirror port.
- Some functions can be used without mirroring settings.

### Visualization of the networks that make up the control system

- OsecT automatically generates an asset ledger and visualize the attributes, roles, and communication status of many devices from a bird's-eye view.
- OsecT clarifies devices and communication points that should be strengthened.
- OsecT makes it possible to grasp unintended device connections and setting changes by visualizing the difference between the asset ledger and communication status for any two periods.

### Visualization of security risks with higher accuracy than ever by implementing proprietary technology

- OsecT makes it possible to grasp the event that leads to the incident by detecting behavior that is different from the regular time.
- OsecT applies NTT's technology cultivated in communication analysis of large-scale networks.
